# E-BloodBank-Portal
This project is a web portal for social services to play a best part for the society and humanity. There are N number of blood bank today in India but still most of the death occurs due to unavailability of blood at the right place at the right time. We have collaborated to 3 or more hospitals that can directly book and order for blood online and get it delivered within a time frame of an hour or less. Donors can directly donate blood to our nearest collection centers that can be found and reached easily by google maps within minutes. Once testing and required stuff is performed the blood is then ready to get delivered if required as per request by hospitals. Hospitals to buy maximum blood get featured on our website. Donors are allotted with points and various basis regarding their social services top donors with maximum points also get featured at our website to motivate and encourage others.
